On chain marketplace for users to conduct peer to peer sales with escrow capability


Traditional online marketplaces such as Ebay often suffer from trust issues, where buyers risk losing their money if sellers fail or even purposely choose to deliver the purchased items, leading to them getting rugged ðŸ˜‚. 

Bettesel solves this by not only providing users with a  P2P onchain platform for them to market their goods and make the deal, but also escrow funds until the dispute period (21 days) has eclipsed. Equitable Dispute Resolution wil be managed by decentralised Juror entities such as Kleros DAO who will provide fair dispute services for all the parties involved.

BetteSel provides users a safety net of fraud protection, giving them more confidence to transact with anonymous individuals on onchain as there is no centralised trust that needs to be given.
